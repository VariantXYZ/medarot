To build:

1. Get baserom.gbc somehow (medarot 1 kabuto version 1.1, md5 78c568cbfff6314b1416880d9efaeca6)
2. Run 'make download && make' to do the initial download and build
3. After making whatever changes are necessary, run make rom again to just build the ROM


TODO:  Make this process cleaner so the user only needs to type in 'make' to incrementally compile
